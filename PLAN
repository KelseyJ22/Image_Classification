TODOs
- read in data properly
- baseline scipy classifiers -- particularly KNN (try with L1 and L2)
- try with both full color and also greyscaled
- neural networks: flattened softmax, then full square CNN
- PCA, SVD, random projections and see how compressed the image can be before the classifier fails
